= Deploying User Code from Clients
[[client-user-code-deployment]]

You can also deploy your code from the client side for the following
situations:

. You have objects that run on the cluster via the clients such as
`Runnable`, `Callable` and `EntryProcessor`.
. You have new user domain objects which need to be deployed into the cluster.

When this feature is enabled on the client, the client will deploy the classes
to the members when connecting. This way, when a client adds a new class, the
members do not require a restart to include it in their classpath.

You can also use the client permission policy to specify which clients
are permitted to use User Code Deployment. See the xref:security:native-client-security.adoc#permissions[Permissions section].

== Configuring Client User Code Deployment

Client User Code Deployment feature is not enabled by default. You can
configure this feature declaratively or programmatically.

NOTE: Using the user code deployment feature is a fit for your functional objects
like `Runnable`, `Callable` and `EntryProcessor`.
For the domain objects, we recommend you to use the
<<accessing-domain-objects-without-domain-classes, generic object interface>> (`GenericRecord`).

Following are example configuration snippets:

**Declarative Configuration:**

In your `hazelcast-client.xml/yaml`:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-client>
    ...
    <user-code-deployment enabled="true">
        <jarPaths>
            <jarPath>/User/example/example.jar</jarPath>
            <jarPath>example.jar</jarPath> <!--from class path -->
            <jarPath>https://com.example.com/example.jar</jarPath>
            <jarPath>file://Users/example/example.jar</jarPath>
        </jarPaths>
        <classNames>
            <!-- for classes available in client's class path -->
            <className>example.ClassName</className>
            <className>example.ClassName2</className>
        </classNames>
    </user-code-deployment>
    ...

      - example.ClassName2

**Programmatic Configuration:**

include::ROOT:example$/ClientUCD.java[tag=clientucd]

[[client-user-code-deployment-note]]
=== Important to Know

To enable all existing and new members in a cluster to receive classes from clients,
make sure that all member configurations follow these rules:

* User Code Deployment must be enabled on the members. Otherwise, the classes
from the client will be ignored. Also blacklisted and non-whitelisted classes
will be ignored.
* All members must be providers, `provider-mode` must be set to
`LOCAL_AND_CACHED_CLASSES` on all members.
* No `provider-filter` must be configured.

Here's a programmatic configuration of the members that will work with client
user code deployment:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/ClientUCD.java[tag=configureMemberForClientUcd]
----

See the <<member-user-code-deployment, Member User Code Deployment section>>
for more information about enabling it on the member side and the configuration properties.

Classes deployed from clients are always cached on the members, no matter
whether `ETERNAL` or `OFF` is configured on the members.

=== Performance Considerations

The client always uploads all added classes and jars to one of the members,
whether it has them or not. So avoid adding large JAR files for each connection
- if configured properly, the member will have the class the next time the
client connects.

=== Two Versions of a Class

If the client uploads a class and the member already has that class, an
exception is thrown if the byte code is different. If byte code is same, it is
ignored. Therefore classes uploaded from the client can't be updated with a new
version.

=== Adding User Library to CLASSPATH

When you want to use a Hazelcast feature in a non-Java client, you need to make
sure that the Hazelcast member recognizes it. For this, you can use the `/user-lib`
directory that comes with the Hazelcast package and deploy your own library to the member.
Let's say you use Hazelcast Node.js client and want to use an entry processor.
This processor should be `IdentifiedDataSerializable` or `Portable` in the Node.js client.
You need to implement the Java equivalents of the processor and its factory on the member side,
and put these compiled class or JAR files into the `/user-lib` directory. Then you can run
the `start.sh` script which adds them to the classpath.

The following is an example code which can be the Java equivalent of
entry processor in the Node.js client:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/settingupclusters/IdentifiedEntryProcessor.java[tag=iep]
----

You can implement the above processor's factory as follows:

[source,java]
----
include::ROOT:example$/settingupclusters/IdentifiedFactory.java[tag=if]
----

And the following is the configuration for the above factory:

[tabs] 
==== 
XML:: 
+ 
-- 
[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast>
    <serialization>
        <data-serializable-factories>
            <data-serializable-factory factory-id="5">
                IdentifiedFactory
            </data-serializable-factory>
        </data-serializable-factories>
    </serialization>
</hazelcast>
----
--

YAML::
+
[source,yaml]
----
hazelcast:
  serialization:
    data-serializable-factories:
      - factory-id: 5
        class-name: IdentifiedFactory
----
====

Then, you can start your Hazelcast member by using the start scripts
(`start.sh` or `start.bat`) in the `/bin` directory. The start scripts
automatically adds your class and JAR files to the classpath.
